However, there were malls I needed to take picture of in Bukit Batok, Hillview and Bukit Timah. As such, I decided to start the route at Bukit Batok, since we would be making lots of detours anyway. This included the detour up to Hillview, where we walked along the rail corridor from there to Bukit Timah. This part was not as secluded as I had initially thought, as we saw many people walking there even on a Monday morning. After reaching Beauty World, the rest of our journey mostly followed the intended route."
