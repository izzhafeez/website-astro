Punggol Park was nice, very lively with people playing all sorts of things like Devil Sticks, but even at 9am it was already very hot. Moving onto Defu, it was obviously boring, with the main attraction being the numbers on the buildings counting up. The river was also average, and hot obviously. So overall, I'm not quite sure why NParks considers this a good urban loop to follow. Probably just spend some time in Punggol Park and you should be good to go. No need for the rest of the journey through industrial estates. Plus this Donovan keeps complaining that his legs tired haiya.",

We followed it all the way to Bukit Panjang, then Hillview, then Beauty World, then Buona Vista, and finally ending at Tanjong Pagar train station.",
    "experience": "There was one BIG problem for this route. IT IS NOT PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY. In the first half of the Rail Corridor, there were two distinct points in Sungei Kadut and Yew Tee where there were no traffic lights that allowed us to cross easily. With large trucks speeding, we didn't want to risk it. So we had to make a big detour to find a traffic light. That was a good 5-10 minutes detouring just to find a suitable traffic light. The middle section was fine, though, as the path was totally clear all the way till we reached Buona Vista. Nice and natural paths, with lots of bollards that indicated our distance covered. All was fine until we reached the end, when the fire nation attacked. Because of the construction of the Circle Line part 5 or 6, the path was all blocked around the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. We simply couldn't find our way to VivoCity, and ended up walking for an additional maybe 2km? Big waste of time. We would've made it to Vivo, or maybe even Sentosa, if it weren't for the construction. Pain.",

The place was practically empty, so I guess she just wanted someone to talk to. Hehe. Okay but apart from that, there was also the Cha Payom people. When I went, I think they just opened, so they were quite... promotional. Good conversation while I was waiting for the drink to be prepared.

    "experience": "I think this was the most rewarding walk. It was one of my earliest ones, and one of the longest as well. We saw so many different parts of Singapore, different challenges, different views. One notable moment was the AMK Linear Park, which was nearing the end of the journey. As we were entering the park, we ran out of water. And guess what? The water cooler was all the way on the other side of the park. It was a quest to get that water! Other notable portions of the walk was the Rail Corridor, where it started to get cloudy really quickly. As such, we had to quicken the pace to get to Beauty World before the rain came. The final stretch of the journey was also quite memorable, seeing the new Punggol development, including the Northshore Plaza. At this point, our speed was pretty much a tortoise's pace, not more than 4kmph. But we made it at 7pm exactly, and it was a great feeling.",
    "refreshments": "We bought ILT at the Toast Box in the Rail Mall, and a quick 15-minute lunch at Subway at Bukit Timah Plaza.

Finally having dinner at Northshore Plaza (A&W). Of course, you can always have a meal at AMK, or Thomson.",

    "experience": "Admittedly, we didn't follow along the Kallang River for the most part, as we made a lot of detours here and there. Basically everywhere had a detour by either construction, or no path. But the parts that we did follow were quite nice. It did start to rain when we were approaching Potong Pasir, though, so we made a stop at the Poiz to wait for the storm to clear up.",
    "refreshments": "We had lunch at Bishan (McDonald's), refilled water at Bishan Loft and bought a drink at the Poiz (or the hawker centre beside it can't remember). You can also buy drinks at Khatib MRT, Mayflower Market, Bishan North Shopping Centre, or Kallang Wave Mall. And maybe dinner at Suntec.",
    "tips": "Nearer to Stadium, your legs will be quite tired, so the overhead bridges there are painful to climb. Just keep that in mind in case you want to visit the Stadium as well. Bring along someone who knows the shortcuts in the area, like this Donovan."

Due to the construction of the North South Corridor, many parts of the journey were very difficult to navigate. The first would be the long section between Khatib and Yio Chu Kang. This section largely follows alongside the MRT track, one of the few places where it remains on the ground. But further along the track, we were forced to divert into the Lentor estate. With tall barriers on one side and landed property on the other side, there was not much to see other than peoples' houses. The section between Yio Chu Kang and Ang Mo Kio was much better, as we followed the cycling path right underneath the MRT line. It's quite a unique vibe, with multiple exercise stations, and quite a number of people hanging out. After Ang Mo Kio, we headed into the Bishan Ang Mo Kio Park, heading straight for the Bubble Playground (which was featured in the 2023 NDP Song). Took a picture and continued on to the McDonald's followed by Bishan and Junction 8. Due to National Day vibes, there was a huge flag hanging outside of Bishan North Shopping Centre, so that was pretty good and unexpected to see. After lunch at Junction 8, we visited a Bishan resident, who was wearing a tank top like an uncle. Went in to refill water. We then made the arduous and confusing journey to Toa Payoh, through its industrial estate in the North. No choice, that's the shortest path into Toa Payoh. I'm not sure if you know about this, but there is a housing estate (Blk 107/109) right outside Braddell MRT that often hangs lots of flags, along with a giant banner signifying Singapore's current age. Pretty cool, and I totally forgot about that when I was planning the walk. Western Toa Payoh is full of super tall residential buildings, in contrast with the older, original Toa Payoh HDB blocks. Southern Toa Payoh leans towards the low-tier side, with the only good part being the design of the interchange (it's circular btw). HDB Hub's atrium was fine, but the rest of the mall didn't quite meet expectations. There also used to be a park to the south of Toa Payoh, but due to construction, it was impassable, which meant we had to take a different way into Balestier. At this point, the sun was scorching, so the shophouses in the Balestier area proved to be quite useful as shelter. We also took refuge in the Novena Squares, preparing for the last portion of our journey. In Novena, also due to the construction, it was pretty confusing to navigate, with traffic lights pointing in all directions. But nothing compares to the ultimate failure of Newton's roundabout. So confusing, so difficult to get around. With Novena, I understand, as it's all under construction. But Newton? Haiyaaaa lamentable.",
    "refreshments": "Bought drinks at Khatib MRT 7-11, refilled water at Yishun Stadium's water cooler, bought ice cream at BAMK McDonald's, ate at Junction 8 Food Junction, refilled water at a VERY SLOW water cooler in Bishan Loft, bought drinks at a random shophouse in Balestier.",
    "tips": "The North South Corridor construction was a major hindrance, causing the route to be both longer than planned, and less attractive visually. But it's still worth a go, as it's a relatively safe walk with lots of places to buy refreshments and to sit down and eat. Just make sure you have enough water, as the journey is quite long."

    "experience": "When we went, much of the interior of Labrador Park was closed, so we couldn't see many of the forts and cannons. But the rest of the park was okay, with the jetty area where people fish. I quite liked the Imbiah trail (with the pavement), where we saw the old Sentosa Monorail. And then there was the skywalk, where the towers were pretty tall. It did start to rain a bit when we were up there, though, so we couldn't stay long. Fort Siloso was a bit more... scary haha.

    "experience": "Okay maybe not the most scenic route, but it wasn't bad either. It was mostly for the sense of accomplishment, as we made it quite far along the Circle Line. The start of the journey was quite mid, mostly seeing the West Coast Highway and the ports and industrial areas. One notable portion was of course the Reflections at Keppel Bay, which are some of the most picturesque houses in Singapore. Once we reached Haw Par Villa, the shortcut to Kent Ridge was rather difficult to find. Indeed, we were deep in the Science Park, taking the direct route to NUS. Lots of stairs, lots of back alleyways, but we made it. Going past Buona Vista and Holland Village, it started to rain quite heavily, which severely impacted our journey. It was just a short rain, yet we made the hasty decision to back track to Buona Vista to have a light lunch. But we didn't end up eating much at Buona Vista, just wasting time. The next few  stations were not super interesting, just passing by landed property and schools at Lorong Chuan and Bartley. We also took a wrong turn at Dakota MRT station, wasting quite a bit of time as well. At the Stadium, there was also an underpass, which required us to walk down and up multiple ramps. Due to our tired legs, this part was torture. The segment between Stadium and Nicoll Highway wasn't to pleasant as well, as it was pretty much darkness by then.",
    "refreshments": "Bought drinks at Vivo, had a break at Star Vista while waiting for the rain to stop, had lunch at Junction 8 (food court on the top floor), bought drinks at Serangoon Bus Interchange, ice cream at Paya Lebar Square, and had dinner at Suntec (Ichikokudo).",
    "tips": "Not for the faint of heart, as it's quite a long walk. But it's quite easy to navigate, as the Circle Line is quite straightforward. Just make sure you have enough water and food to last the whole walk. Don't rest for more than 30 minutes, or else your legs will give up on you. So lunch has to be fast."

Firstly, it's pretty far from civilisation. Walking there was a little difficult, as we had to climb the SLE flyover, which was narrow and had a lot of bikers. Secondly, 'Beware of Flying Balls', as there is a golf course right next to the park, disrupting the natural feel a little. Thomson Nature Park on the other hand truly felt ulu. It really felt that there was history there, with remnants of a kampong and structures around the place. The route was also quite easy to follow, as there were railings all around so you won't get lost. There were also quite a number of people there, so it isn't as creepy as you may think.

    "experience": "Let's start with the two main attractions: the Clubhouse and the Air Force Museum.\nThe Clubhouse feels really empty. Like there's little to no furnishing in the main areas. Maybe add some plants here and there? Maybe add some more food options? Or perhaps a seated waiting area? It just feels really unfinished. But to be fair, there's pretty unique attractions too. You have the standard swimming pools, BBQ pits, chalets and function rooms. But there's also the water park and trampoline park. Lots of high elements, looks quite good.\nThe Air Force Museum was better than expected. Lots of old yet well-maintained planes on display. There's also the display on level 2, which is all about the history of RSAF, along with copious amounts of self-praise. I appreciate that it's there, but I likely won't be going there any time soon.\nOkay now let's talk about one particular part of the journey. For some reason, Google recommends walking alongside the Bartley Road East on the way to the Museum. However, IT'S ALL GRASS??!!! The pavement just stops, and there's probably around 800m of grass to walk on. Terrible experience, since we were sandwiched between a fence and a busy road.\nAnother part of the journey that I don't understand is Bedok Reservoir. Why did they make the track out of sand? I don't like sand. It's course and rough, and it gets everywhere. My socks were full of sand afterwards. Is it to give the reservoir a beach view? Or do the designers not like wearing shoes?\nThe most surprising part of the journey was the figurine house at Jalan Chempaka Kuning. I didn't realise it was there when I planned the route, so it was a welcomed surprise =).",

Then, we visited Junction 10, Hillion Mall and Bukit Panjang Plaza. After that, it was quite late already, so we stopped there.",
    "experience": "Haiya this Donovan we say meet at 9am but he come at 930am. So late... So anyway, I expected the Little Guilin to be bigger. But it's just a rock. It looked great in picture, but in reality, maybe not so much... Maybe Big Guilin will be better. As for Le Quest, well... I've been there before, about 2 years ago. And the construction is still there haiya... The mall also has pretty much nothing. All the shops are on the outside, with only a Koufu inside. Tengah, on the other hand, is shaping up to be quite a nice and modern place. Of course, the planted trees are still small, so it's still quite sunny out, but the architecture looks promising. The design of the Plantation Plaza itself was pretty good as well, with very tall ceilings and wood accents. But of course, there were basically only 3 shops (Koufu, Giant and McDonalds) so there was nothing much to do but take the bus 992 out of there. As for West Mall, I've been there twice before, so there was nothing new to see. But overall, despite the construction outside, West Mall is one of my favourite, as it's atrium looks top-tier. Very open and tall, making the mall seem huge. Next up, we have Lot One. With little natural light, and a rather small central atrium, the mall seems quite dark and small. Architecture is just a boring white and shiny. The LRT walk was quite okay. Nothing much to see other than the HDBs and the stations themselves, but the talking/banter was fun. Arriving at Bukit Panjang, I've been to the malls before, so there's nothing much more to add. But here's my summary of them. Junction 10 is dark and narrow, with the second floor being a corridor for tuition centres. Hillion Mall has a really great exterior, but a VERY poorly-designed interior. Narrow and short corridors, non-existent atrium, and with a bus interchange making navigation difficult. Very confusing layout, which messes with your sense of direction. Lastly, Bukit Panjang Plaza was my favourite, and remains one of my favourite malls to visit. Large and tall central atrium with tonnes of natural light, and a very open layout. The shops are all around the atrium, so it's easy to navigate. The library also has a unique quirk, being split in half into the children section and the adult section.",

But the best part has to be the TreeTop Walk, which was quite clear and sunny on the day, to really enjoy the nature. Very high yet very safe.
