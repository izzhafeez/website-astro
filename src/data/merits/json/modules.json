These diagrams are written in <<../merits/technologies/plant-uml>>PlantUML</>, which is relatively easy to use, considering that they handle most of the formatting for you.\nSecondly, it teaches you proper project management and version control using <<../merits/technologies/github>>Git</>. For example, how to use the Issue Tracker, as well as how to create, review and merge a Pull Request.\nThroughout the semester, the module admins track your individual and team's progress through the code. It checks for deliverables, as well as certain milestones. **Try to clear them as quickly as possible**, lest you get swamped in your other modules.\nThe first half of the module involves creating a simple chatbot in <<../merits/languages/java>>Java</>, which gets us comfortable with the language, so that we are more prepared for the team project. Every week, there will be a set of features that you will have to implement, so they will check whether these features have been completed by the end of each week. Don't worry too much about this mini-project, though, as most people will get full marks anyway.\nThe main bulk of the workload comes in the second half of the semester. This is when hell breaks loose in the form of the team project (tP). Teams would need to work with an existing codebase (of around 10k lines). The existing code is for a simple AddressBook application that stores your contact list. Your job is to improve upon the application by making modifications of your own, or repurposing it entirely.\nThere is also the Practical Examination (PE), which has the most gruesome format imaginable. Essentially, for the PE, you are given a random group's project. And you are supposed to **find bugs** in that project. Whatever bugs you find adds to your PE score, whilst also subtracting from that team's project score. I was a little too nice with my rating of the other team's project, but I think everything turned out fine.\nFinals, though, was brutal, as we were tested on software engineering principles, but in a very confusing way. Basically, the lecture notes usually explain a certain way of doing things (like whether to draw an arrowed or non-arrowed line when connecting two objects in an Object Diagram). However, the finals blurs the line and **tests us on the minute details**, which often come across as painfully cryptic. They trap and trick us with **confusing questions** that don't really serve a purpose in the real world. I guess that's my biggest gripe with this module, and where I lost most of my marks."

As such, make it your best effort to **do this module with friends** and people you know well. Doesn't matter if you get an 8AM slot, just do it together. Apes together **strong**."

This is crucial in the real world, because most of the files we work with, and most of the internet uses these concepts very frequently. Starting with Fourier Transform, the module teaches us that higher frequencies are harder to detect, which means we can easily remove them and not lose that much information. We later moved on to sampling, convolution and correlation, which were not explained very well, so I ended up skipping most of the later lectures.\nLater on, we moved on to image processing, which means removing as much detail from images as possible, without destroying too much of the quality. We can do this because the human eye is not very perceptive to small changes in color, giving rise to the JPEG compression algorithm, which was a big topic in this module. There was a whole section for string compression, where we learnt the inner workings of algorithms such as LZW, Run Length Encoding (RLE) and the famous Huffman Coding, which all have their strength and weaknesses.\nFor homework, we were given MatLab assignments, where we had to implement these algorithms from scratch. I think they were okay, but we had to do a lot of Googling to learn MatLab on our own. 6 MatLab worksheets in total.\nThere was also a project, where we had to implement the JPEG compression algorithm in MatLab. However, there was a twist. Normally, the algorithm uses a certain Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) function to convert the pixel data into frequencies. This led to real numbers for the frequencies, so they can easily be encoded. For the project, however, we had to use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which gives rise to complex frequencies. This made it considerably more difficult to encode and decode the image, as we had to keep track of both the real and imaginary components of the frequencies. In conjunction with MatLab's poor debugging tools, this project was rather difficult."

Prof said no point studying, so okay.\nBut I guess the advice I could give for the project would be that the Prof cares most about the students' learning. As such, you need to prove to him that you put in the effort. The project doesn't need to be the best quality. So whatever you've tried, put it in a backup file or something.

One of the more important ones is the introduction of **informed search algorithms**, where you can direct your search algorithm to your destination. A thorough understanding is important, as it will be heavily tested during the Midterms. Also in that half of the semester, we were taught about **decision trees** and **information entropy**, which is essentially how much information is contained in a set of data, representing the uncertainty or randomness within that data. Of course, you will have to implement these algorithms in Python to submit as your assignments.\nThe second half of the module teaches us about Pytorch and machine learning principles. Basically, supervised learning (you tell the model what is right or wrong), unsupervised learning (the model finds patterns in the data) and neural networks (the model can learn and make predictions after multiple failures). The homework for this part of the module were not so straightforward, as we often had to do up visualisations for how good the model is etc.\nThe finals for the module was a **28-hour Kaggle-like competition**, where we had to compete against one another to produce the best-performing model. The dataset we were given was not based on any real-life data, so we couldn't use any prior knowledge to help us create our model.

We learn the different ways to formulate such problems in a standardised way, so that the same algorithm can be applied to all the problems. This is the Simplex Method.\nWe also learn the Dual Simplex Method, which solves the same problem but approaching it from a different angle.\nWe also went through Sensitivity Analysis, which is how we can predict how the costs and capacities would change relative to each other. In other words, if the production capacity of a certain item is increased, how much would the total cost change?\nThe last topic involves network optimisation, where we can solve graph optimisation problems such as shortest path, maximal flow, minimum cost flow, salesman and minimal spanning tree problems. I found this part interesting because all these very different graph problems can be solved in the same way. It's just that the formulation of the problem can differ slightly."
