Overall, the lessons were not effective.\nI quickly defaulted to learning Korean on my trusted companion, Duolingo. I also found multiple websites with tonnes of free lesson material that helps to supplement my learning. To practice, I also use HelloTalk to speak to native Korean speakers, though I must say my experience in using Korean HelloTalk was not as extensive as that for French or Spanish.

This module places heavy emphasis on understanding signals and how to process them. It features weekly programming assignments in MatLab, where we have to implement certain algorithms, and compute certain signal values all in MatLab. These were quite tedious, since the lecturer didn't give us any guidance on how to use the language. Instead, we were left to self-learn the language in order to complete the assignments. They weren't hard. Just tedious. There was also the pair project, where we had to implement the JPEG compression algorithm using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), instead of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This meant our implementation was bound to be less powerful than the actual JPEG compression, so my partner and I found it quite challenging.\nBut I think this experience has definitely built up my confidence in developing algorithms in MatLab, but unless I'm forced to, I won't use it."

However, that changed in 2019, when I finally had the time to slowly go through the grammar lessons on other websites, and managed to reach a B1 level (based on the practice papers I've done). But yet again, due to my lack of experience in speaking the language, I found it difficult to get past the oral component of the DELE test."
