I found it the easiest to pickup for both frontend and backend, as it is relatively easy to set up a project in PHP. But the drawbacks of using a simple language really starts to show when trying to develop larger projects. It simply doesn't have the capability to develop anything major. As such, I've only ever created 1 other project outside of the frontend course. I'd rather use more sophisticated languages and technologies."
