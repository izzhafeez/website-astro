Due to my over-zealousness during that semester, I ended up contributing 18,000+ lines of code to the codebase. As such, I think I have enough Software Engineering experience for now, or at least in Java.\nBesides that, I've done some software development on <<../merits/languages/rust>>Rust</>, where I made modifications to the <<../projects/coding/neothesia>>Neothesia</> project, which I adapted to suit my needs."

I set up over 50 unit test cases, which test different aspects of each API (error handling etc.)\n2. **Integration Testing**: I used Postman Flows to test the integration of different API endpoints of NoteTogether, creating complex networks of logic flow to simulate an actual interaction.\n3. **System Testing**: For more thorough testing of NoteTogether's backend design, I used Python to send requests to the server, and verify that all the data is updated accordingly.\n4. **Regression Testing**: For NoteTogether, the regression testing was done using GitHub Actions, using Python to run some scripts that test the behaviour of the app.\n5. **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment**: For NoteTogether, most of the CI/CD was done by my partner so my main experience in this area would be in the deployment of this personal site, where the build command is run in GitHub Actions.\n6. **Frontend Testing**: I like web scraping, so for NoteTogether, I was responsible for the frontend testing as well. Using Selenium on Python, I created scripts that mimicked the behaviour of the end user and tested whether the front responded accordingly.\n7. **Load Testing**: Using Python requests again, I tested the behaviour of our application at different loads, and made a regression curve approximating its performance as load increases.\n8. **Stress Testing**: Using Python requests again, I tested the ability of the application to handle high amounts of traffic. In particular, whether a large number of requests coming in would lead to a mismatch in fields."

Exploring different websites, finding patterns within data, and extracting and parsing the relevant information is quite satisfying to me. It gives a much better indication to me whether I did my job properly, as compared to machine learning and AI.\nMy first proper taste of Web Scraping came during my time in <<../merits/experiences/data-analytics>>National Service</>, where I had to extract out information pertaining to police stations and police posts, as well as community centres. This involved certain trickeries that were very fun to do.\nAnd while I do have some experience in <<../merits/technologies/selenium>>Selenium</>, I must say that most of my experience comes from BeautifulSoup and my own creation <<../projects/coding/spiderman-scraper>>Spiderman Scraper</>, which is a custom web scraper I've built."
