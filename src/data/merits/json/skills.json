This involved certain trickeries that were very fun to do.\nAnd while I do have some experience in <<../merits/technologies/selenium>>Selenium</>, I must say that most of my experience comes from BeautifulSoup and my own creation <<../projects/coding/spiderman-scraper>>Spiderman Scraper</>, which is a custom web scraper I've built."
